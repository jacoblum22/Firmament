## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW**

### **Storage Strategy** (Hybrid Sharing)
```
User uploads file ‚Üí Same content hash generated for all users
                 ‚Üì
File stored in:  User-specific path (privacy)
Cache stored in: Shared path (efficiency)
                 ‚Üì
Benefits: Privacy maintained + Processing costs shared
```

### **Authentication Flow**
```
Frontend ‚Üí Google OAuth ‚Üí Backend verifies token ‚Üí JWT session token
                                                ‚Üì
All API calls include JWT token ‚Üí User-specific storage paths
```

### **File Processing**
```
Upload ‚Üí S3 Storage ‚Üí Temp file for processing ‚Üí Results to shared cache
      ‚Üì                                        ‚Üì
   User storage                           User-specific results
```
